                            Light Yagami discovers a notebook that claims to be able to kill anyone whose name
                            and
                            face is known to its owner. He initially dismisses the so-called "Death Note" as a
                            hoax,
                            but, after testing its powers, he discovers that these claims are indeed real. The
                            original owner, a shinigami named Ryuk, approaches Light and explains that the
                            notebook
                            now belongs to him. Since Light is the new owner, he is the only one who can see and
                            interact with Ryuk. The shinigami also says that when Light's time to die comes,
                            Ryuk
                            will be the one to write down his name in his book. Light decides to use the Death
                            Note's power to rid the world of evil and become the god of a new, peaceful world.
